# Fixes

- [JIRA_ID](https://humandecode.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/BDA/boards/25?modal=detail&selectedIssue=BDA-8&quickFilter=51)

## General Overview
Anchor button's using with all routes
The file getBirthdaysInfo.js create GET request of info
The file card.js, create component
navBar_Desktop and navBar_Mobile components
The route birthdays.js render info with getServerSideProps() and return my <Card/> with props.

The information has not yet been rendered based on nearby birthdays in the next 7 days.
I want to know if I am doing well before continuing to implement code, or continue messing around.
### URLs affected

- http://localhost:3000/birthdays

- http://localhost:3000/terms

*I created the bases to start working on user stories 3 and 4:*

- http://localhost:3000/allBirthdays

- http://localhost:3000/newBirthday


## Change Examples
CSS in terms.module.css, card.module.css, footer.module.css, navBar.module.css (desktop and mobile)

## Technical Overview
Doubts about how to render birthdays using the date-fns package, I have tried different options but did not get the desired results. I've seen ways that would work using the native JavaScript methods. I need help, guidance or clearer examples of what my way forward should be at this point üôè.

### Changes

- I don't know how to write or what to include in this part :)
