This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The design for mobile devices you can see and try it yourself! on: https://birthday-app-three.vercel.app/

In the following images you can find a quick look at its content.

Registration system with validations in all fields and designs that indicate errors to the user:

All CRUD methods are present in this app...

By clicking the email icon that only appears when it's someone's birthday, you can send your congratulations through the "mailto" functionality I've integrated:

You can also remove any cards added through this same beautiful Modal.

If there are more than 5 cards, either in the /birthdays or /all-birthdays path, a pagination will be generated:

You can also search between the cards in both routes using the registered names or emails:
